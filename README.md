# Stopwatch

## Overview

This project is part of the Codevixens 10 Days of Frontend Challenge (Day 8). This stopwatch web application was built using Vite React and TailwindCSS. The task focuses on mastering state management, event handling and lifecycle methods.

## Features

- **State Management:** React's **useState** hook were used to handle elapsed time and running state of the stopwatch.
- **Event Handling:** This handles click events for the start, stop and reset buttons.
- **User Interface:** There are three buttons, which allows the user start, stop and reset the timer. There is also a display for the elapsed time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: ```javascript git clone https://github.com/Nkwor-Jane/stopwatch-app.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory: ```javascript cd stopwatch-app```

3. Install dependencies:```javascript npm install```

## Usage

1. Start the development server: ```javascript npm run dev```

2. Open your browser and navigate to: ```javascript http://localhost:5173/```

## How it Works

The Stopwatch component is the main React component. It handles the following:

1. **State Management:** Manages elapsed time and the running state of the stopwatch using useState.

2. **Rendering UI:** Renders three buttons, which allows the user start, stop and reset the timer. There is also a display for the elapsed time.

3. **Event Handling:** This handles click events for the start, stop and reset buttons.
